# Part 2 Extensions

## Extension 1
Implement the below `PATCH /pets/:id` API method. It should be possible for the user to provide any combination of valid fields to update.

### PUT /pets/:id

Example Request
```sh
curl -X PUT localhost:3030/pets/52 \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"age": 41}'
```

Example Response
```json
{
  "pet" : {
    "id":52,
    "name": "Ollie", 
    "age": 41, 
    "type":"cat", 
    "breed":"tabby",
    "microchip":true
  }
}
```
## Extension 2

Implement the below `GET /breeds` API method. This should use the existing data in the pets table. You will need to use `DISTINCT` in your SQL.

### GET /breeds
Return all **unique** pet breeds for a given type. 

Parameter | Value | Required | Description
-|-|-|-
`type` |Any string | Yes | Filter breeds to only animals of the specified type

Example Request
```sh
curl localhost:3030/breeds?type=dog
```

Example Response
```json
{
  "breeds" : [
    {
      "breed": "Basset Bleu de Gascogne"
    },
    {
      "breed": "East Siberian Laika"
    },
    {
      "breed": "Slovakian Wirehaired Pointer"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extension 3
Implement validation so that if the client attempts to:
* `PUT` a pet that does exist
* `PUT` a pet without a required field
* `PATCH` a pet that doesn't exist
* `DELETE` a pet that doesn't exist
An error is returned to the client with a suitable message and HTTP code.

## Extension 4
If not already done so, update your code structure to follow the example from Part 1 Extension 2.
